NAME: Escape to Space in a Hot Air Balloon (Since the earth is lava)

Core Loop: Auto-drift right over slowly rising lava. Click and Hold on the balloon to collect golden balloon within your magnet range. Each balloon is worth coins (starts at 1 balloon = 1 coin). Spend coins on basket buildings (passive coin production, auto attack, health, magnet strength, balloon value, energy production). Use energy to power electric heating elements to rise higher, slowly going through 4 cloud layers. Hostile balloons appear every 2 minutes, either rise out of their way, or take them out with your auto attack. Taking damage causes you to lower, if the enemy takes enough damage that they go below the screen, they release several golden balloons that you can collect.

Behavior: Float left to right using a slow sine wave. (the background should be moving to simulate the player moving, the players hot air balloon should always stay in the middle of the screen)

the lava is slowly rising (amount should be defined in config) if the players balloon hits the lava it's game over.

The player wins if they escape the 4th cloud layer and make it to space.
